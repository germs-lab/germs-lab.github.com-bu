Phil Colgan has been selected to receive the Harold and Katerhine Guy Graduate Fellowship because of his outstanding research in soil and water conservation.  
Phil is a 2nd year graduate student in the GERMS Lab, where he studies the impact of modern agricultural management practices on the microbial communities associated with agricultural soil and water. His research is focused on better understanding the transfer, spread and persistence of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment surrounding manure applied cropland. He hopes to use this experience to inform management practices to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and also to help develop more comprehensive methods of detecting those resistance genes for risk assessment.

Congrats Phil -- we're lucky to have you here!  

Here's Phil with the lab during a [Fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(Sweden):
