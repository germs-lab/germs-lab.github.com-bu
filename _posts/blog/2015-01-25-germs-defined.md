I spent some time thinking about my vision and mission for our group
for a
[faculty presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/adinachuanghowe/adinas-faculty-introduction-isu-abe).

I'm sure this will evolve with my group but here it is...

#Mission
We are changing the environment that we live in. To preserve our
environmental integrity, we must understand and manage the impacts of
global change. Scientific research must inform our decisions and policy.
Therefore, we use innovative scientific methods to evaluate and understand our complex and changing natural world.

#Vision
* To provide scalable, quantitative tools to monitor microbial responses in complex environments
* To identify the microbial drivers responding to global change in complex environments (e.g., soils, waters, gut)
* To predict and model the impacts of microbial responses on ecosystem health and services

And the adventure begins...
