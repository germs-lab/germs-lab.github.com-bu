NGS 2015 was a great success and many of the students are working on awesome, impactful projects saving the world.  

We covered lessons dealing with assembly and variant calling.  

Ryan tried out his new co-occurence tutorial.  See course materials at the [course website](http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2015/).
