We successfully hosted our first Data Carpentry at Iowa State!  It was a huge success based on the feedback that the students want even MORE!  Jin was also an instructor for this course -- the whole lab is helping to pay our training forward!

We covered the flow of data analysis in a typical genomics project and how one might automate many of the tasks.
