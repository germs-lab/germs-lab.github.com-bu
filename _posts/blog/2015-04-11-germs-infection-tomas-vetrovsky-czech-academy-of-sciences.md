Tomas Vetrovsky from Petr Baldrian's group of the Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology and the Institute of Microbiology CAS, Prague visited GERMS for two weeks this April.  

I asked him to write a blog post about his experience here at ISU.  I'd also like to highlight Tomas's fantastic game, Garden of Ants (see below),  that he developed which is a hybrid between a soil ecosystem and Starcraft.  It is in its alpha stage but very playable on both Mac and PC - we had a ton of fun with it.  You basically play the role of an ant colony trying to establish colonization in a fungal forest.  

Here's his post:

Most memorable things about visit:
-----------
 * Kind and open minded people
 * Wide possibilities for (self)realization
 * Chinese food 

What puzzles me about Americans:
-----------
 * Taxes
 * Tips
 * It is a huge country

Research Interests:
-----------
 * Ecology of microorganisms participating in organic matter transformation. 
 * Use of molecular biology methods including the high-throughput-sequencing (HTS) methods to analyze the genomes and transcriptomes of isolated strains and environmental metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. 
 * Bioinformatics, data analysis and development of software tools.
 * Social insects

Tools that I share:
-----------
 * **SEED** - is a free-to-use GUI-based sequence editor and pipeline for fast bioinformatic analysis of PCR amplicons on desktop computers according to the suggested workflow

## Garden of Ants
**Garden of Ants** - is a platform independent real-time strategy written in java. The game simulates a living strategy of hypothetical ant species [it is mainly inspired by leaf cutting ants - Atta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atta_%28genus%29).
