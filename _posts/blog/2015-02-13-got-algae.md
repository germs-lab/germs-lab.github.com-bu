###GERMS infect Bioprocess Algae

The GERMS lab traveled to Shenandoah, Iowa (taking the scenic route
through Missouri and Nebraska because we were to geeked out in our
science conversations).  There, we were hosted by Joshua Livermore
(Mr. Algae Pro) of [Bioprocess Algae](http://www.bioprocessalgae.com).
Sustainably located right next to an ethanol plant, it was a terrific
exploration of how one can grow algae in the middle of wintry Iowa and
how managing microbial resources can make real economic impact as this
industry begins to grow.

We sadly forgot to take a photo of ourselves in front of the plant
with Mr. Algae Pro, but we did make it to the not-to-be-missed
windmill in Elkhorn, Iowa.

A fantastic trip, with hopefully a future visit and collaboration.
