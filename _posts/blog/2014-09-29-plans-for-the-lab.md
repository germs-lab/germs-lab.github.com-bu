# The Next Adventure

Starting in January, 2015, I will be beginning my adventure at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/) in [Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering](http://www.abe.iastate.edu).  There, I'll be leading up the [GERMS lab](germslab.org).

I cannot understate how excited I am about this and how grateful I am to have this opportunity and for the help along the way.

# My Plans

You can read my application material on the lab website, but I summarize the gist of it here.

My personal goals for this lab are simple:

* Use what I've learned to make measurable impacts on understanding and managing the microbes around us
* Create an energetic and productive environment for research
* Mentor students to become outstanding researchers and people

I'm looking forward to continue some of my on-going research:

* Understanding the awesome diversity of microbes around us and how to model and manage their impacts on our lives
* Exploring the impacts of viruses on these communities and our health and environment
* Development of methods for environmental omic-based methods, connecting the dots between sequencing technologies and understanding complex microbial communities

Some directions I'm looking forward to exploring include:

* Moving beyond metagenomic discovery and characterization towards modeling and managing communities
* Improving the available biomarkers to detect and quantify pathogens and antibiotic genes in the environment
* Developing open-source eductational resources and classes making computational biology more assessible
* Exploring big data and the role of microbial data in predictive agriculture
* Many many more...I'm very much looking forward to all the collaborative opportunities at Iowa State.
