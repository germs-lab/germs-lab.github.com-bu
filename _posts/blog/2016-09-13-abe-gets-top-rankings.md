### "Being #1 in Agricultural Engineering is way better than being #1 in football..."  -- ABE faculty

The [US News and World Report’s 2017 “Best Colleges” rankings](http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2016/09/13/us-news-rankings-2017) just came out, and ABE is tied for 1st place with Purdue.  I'm proud of the department, not because we're #1, but because its an outstanding place to work where young faculty, postdocs, and students are supported.
