* This position has been filled * 

## PhD integrating global change, microbial ecology, environmental sciences, limnology, and data sciences

The GERMS Laboratory at Iowa State University is looking for an enthusiastic, motivated PhD student to help develop novel methods to assess the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of waters by integrating genomic microbial characterization with an extensive water quality monitoring program.  The impact of this research can transform traditional water quality indicators and provide critical insight into how water quality is monitored and evaluated. This position will provide you with the opportunity to learn and work with cutting edge molecular methods for environmental microbiology and analysis of a variety of datasets.  We provide an inter-disciplinary training opportunity, and you will train with scientists with expertise in microbiology, limnology, environmental science, and bioinformatics.   You will also have the opportunity to collaborate closely with the [ISU Limnology Laboratory](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~downing/).

Qualifications:

* Strong organizational and record keeping skills.
* Effective oral and written communication skills.
* Ability to interact with an interdisciplinary team. 
* Previous research experience.
* Interest in data analysis.

*Preferred* â€“ background in microbiology and/or bioinformatics, experience with a programming language. 

If you are interested in this position, you should apply to the ISU graduate program in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, Environmental Science, Interdepartmental Microbiology Program, or Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.  The ideal start date is May, 2015.   Contact germs.research@gmail.com with any questions.
