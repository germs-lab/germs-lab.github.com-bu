## PhD integrating climate change, microbial ecology, land use, environmental sciences, microbiology, and data sciences

The GERMS Laboratory at Iowa State University is looking for an enthusiastic, motivated PhD student to help develop novel methods to identify the microbial carbon drivers in bioenergy crop soils and to improve current climate models with microbial datasets.  The impact of this research can help sustainable land management policy and identify microbial benefits for soil health and productivity.  This position will provide you with the opportunity to learn and work with cutting edge molecular methods and datasets for environmental microbiology and microbial ecology.  This position will be mainly data-driven, though opportunities to participate, implement, and design experiments exist.  You will have the opportunity to collaborate closely with the [Hofmockel Laboratory](http://kirstenhofmockel.org/) at ISU.  

Qualifications:
•	Strong organizational and record keeping skills.
•	Effective oral and written communication skills.
•	Ability to interact with an interdisciplinary team. 
•	Previous research experience.
•	Interest in data analysis.

•	Preferred – background in microbiology and/or bioinformatics, experience with a programming language. 

If you are interested in this position, you should apply to the ISU graduate program in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, Environmental Science, Interdepartmental Microbiology Program, or Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.  This position is available immediately.  Contact germs.research@gmail.com with any questions.
