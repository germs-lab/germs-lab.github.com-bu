# Become one of the GERMS! #

We take an interdisciplinary approach to understand and manage natural and engineering microbial systems.  We are interested in combining molecular approaches and biological sequencing data to study complex microbial communities.  We are also interested in sustainable scientific data/software development practices.  We are interested in working with microbiologists, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and more.  

If you are interested in joining GERMS as a graduate student, you should apply to the ISU graduate program in [Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering](http://www.abe.iastate.edu/prospective-students/apply-today/), [Environmental Science](http://www.ensci.iastate.edu/grad/applying.html), [Interdepartmental Microbiology Program](http://www.micro.iastate.edu/), or [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](http://www.bcb.iastate.edu/Prospect.html#Apply).    

Currently, we are looking for candidates in most positions (PhDs, Masters, and undergraduates).
