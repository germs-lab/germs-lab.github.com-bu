#GERMS Mission
We are changing the environment that we live in.  To preserve our environmental integrity, we must understand and manage the impacts of global change.  Scientific research must inform our decisions and policy.  Therefore, we will develop and employ innovative scientific methods to evaluate and understand our complex and changing world.

#GERMS Vision
To monitor, evaluate, and manage our microbial partners and their services.  More specificially, our vision is:

* To provide *scalable, quantitative tools* to *monitor* microbial responses in complex environments  
* To *identify* the microbial *drivers* responding to global change in complex environments (e.g., soils, waters, gut)
* To *predict and model* the *impacts* of microbial responses on ecosystem health and services

#GERMS Research
Our work focuses on integrating traditional microbiology approaches with metagenomics and computational biology as investigative tools to understand environmental microbial populations.

Currently, our research revolves around several themes:

* identifying microbial drivers of biogeochemical cycling and their response to climate change 
* understanding contributions of microbial genes, individuals, and groups to population function and dynamics
* detection of biomarkers for environmental health (e.g., antibiotics and pathogens)
* scalability of increasingly large sequencing datasets through the application of advanced computational approaches
* leveraging high throughput, next-generation metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing to investigate interactions within environmental microbial communities

We are a part of [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu) and the [Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering Department](http://www.abe.iastate.edu).  We are also affiliated with ISU [Environmental Science](http://www.enscigrad.iastate.edu), [Interdepartmental Microbiology Program](http://www.micrograd.iastate.edu/), and [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](http://www.bcb.iastate.edu).

We are currently supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Black and Veatch Building a World of Difference Faculty Fellowship; the University of Iowa Center for Health Effect of Environmental Contamination; the Iowa Pork Producers Association; the National Pork Board; and USDA NIFA.
