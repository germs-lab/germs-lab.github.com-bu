Our work focuses on integrating traditional microbiology approaches with metagenomics and computational biology as investigative tools to understand environmental microbial populations.

Currently, our research revolves around several themes: 

* identifying microbial drivers of biogeochemical cycling and their response to climate change 
* understanding contributions of microbial genes, individuals, and groups to population function and dynamics 
* detection of biomarkers for environmental health in our environment (e.g., antibiotics and pathogens) 
* scalability of increasingly large sequencing datasets through the application of advanced computational approaches 
* leveraging high throughput, next-generation metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing to investigate interactions within environmental microbial communities
