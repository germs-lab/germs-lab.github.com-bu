Our work focuses on integrating traditional microbiology approaches with metagenomics and computational biology as investigative tools to understand environmental microbial populations.

Currently, our research revolves around several themes: 

* identifying microbial drivers of biogeochemical cycling and their response to climate change 
* understanding contributions of microbial genes, individuals, and groups to population function and dynamics 
* detection of biomarkers for environmental health (e.g., antibiotics and pathogens) 
* scalability of increasingly large sequencing datasets through the application of advanced computational approaches 
* leveraging high throughput, next-generation metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing to investigate interactions within environmental microbial communities

We are a part of [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu) and the [Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering Department](http://www.abe.iastate.edu).  We are also affiliated with ISU [Environmental Science](http://www.ensci.iastate.edu), [Interdepartmental Microbiology Program](http://www.micro.iastate.edu/), and [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](http://www.bcb.iastate.edu).

We are supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biolgoical and Environmental Research (BER), Black and Veatch Building a World of Difference Faculty Fellowship, the University of Iowa Center for Health Effect of Environmental Contamination.
